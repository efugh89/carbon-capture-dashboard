<h3>Inflation Reduction Act and the Biden Administration</h3>

<p>The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into effect by President Biden on August 16, 2022. The act was aimed at increasing tax breaks for the purpose of “boost[ing] clean energy, reduc[ing] healthcare costs, and increas[ing] tax revenues” (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it">McKinsey & Company</a>). Specifically, the IRA expands on the existing 45Q tax credit which is a “performance-based tax credit for carbon management projects” and it raises the credit for sequestered carbon dioxide from $60/tonnes to $85/tonnes (<a href="https://carboncapturecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45Q-primer-Carbon-Capture-Coalition.pdf">Carbon Capture Coalition</a>). The increase in this tax credit is to encourage more people to invest in or participate in carbon storage projects.</p>

<h3>Health and Safety Concerns</h3>

<p>Where can you build a carbon sequestration facility? In pretty much any middle to high income neighborhood, the thought of a carbon sequestration facility, or anything related is impossible. A company wouldn’t even dream of pitching that internally, nevermind actually to the community itself. Furthermore, middle and high income neighborhoods often have strict zoning laws that protect the sanctity of the community. With roots in segregation, this is not true for lower income neighborhoods. That’s the reason why neighborhoods like St Rose, Louisiana obtain nicknames like “Cancer Alley”.</p>

<p><i>For those interested in the topic of residential segregation, give "The Color of Law" by Richard Rothstein a read.</i></p>

<p>St Charles Clean Fuels (SCCF) is planning to build a blue ammonia and hydrogen facility nearby St Rose where they will capture and release carbon dioxide to a later sequester. Critics, of course, not only doubt the industry’s 90% carbon dioxide capture claims, but point out that these facilities release more than just carbon dioxide, which is left to pollute the local air.</p>

<p>Furthermore, to transport the carbon dioxide from this facility to sequestration facilities, they will have to travel thousands of miles via pipelines built throughout the United States.</p>

<p>Though the events that occurred in Satartia, MS happened more than four years ago, it returned to the public consciousness in the wake of the Biden administration’s investment in carbon dioxide storage and transportation projects.</p>

<p>In February 2020, A pipeline transporting carbon dioxide between facilities experienced a rupture which released carbon dioxide into the air for around four hours. Even though the rupture occurred in open air, the carbon dioxide did not disperse enough to avoid serious injury to the residents. More than 200 people from the town were evacuated, while 45 were admitted to the hospital. Many of Satartia’s residents still suffer from impairments that they attribute to this incident. Federal regulators that investigated the pipeline rupture found that the operator, Denbury Inc., violated federal regulations which led to the leak. Despite knowing immediately that the leak had occurred, the company did not alert the local authorities.</p>

<p>This incident occurred at a pipeline, and not at a carbon injection site, but this story is still a relevant concern. More carbon dioxide capture and storage projects means more pipelines to transfer carbon dioxide between sites. Jesse Jenkins, a professor at Princeton University, predicts that the amount of pipelines in America could grow from 5,300 miles (at the time of the article’s writing) to more than 65,000 miles. Competitors of Denbury claim that the fault lies with the company, and that regulation surrounding pipelines is strong, but without strong enforcement and preventative measures, similar incidents as what happened in Satartia, MS are bound to happen and affect others.</p>

<p>Denbury Inc’s punishment was a $2.8 million fine to the US Government. </p>
