<h3>What is Carbon Capture, Usage, and Storage?</h3>

<p> Carbon Capture, Usage, and Storage (colloquially known as CCUS) is defined by the London School of Economics and Political Science as “a suite of technologies that enable the mitigation of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from large point sources such as power plants, refineries and other industrial facilities, or the removal of existing CO2 from the atmosphere” (<a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-is-carbon-capture-and-storage-and-what-role-can-it-play-in-tackling-climate-change/#:~:text=What%20is%20carbon%20capture%2C%20usage%20and%20storage%20(CCUS)%3F,CO2%20from%20the%20atmosphere">“What is Carbon Capture?”</a>). For the purpose of this project, we are only interested in the technology that allows CO2 to be stored underground, whether that be for solely keeping it out of our atmosphere or for other purposes. This technology has gained a lot more attention in recent years as efforts to control climate change and reverse our damage on the planet intensify. </p>

<p>In the United States, organizations that are interested in carbon storage report to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) which is a part of their Office of Atmospheric Protection (OAP). The different types of emissions being tracked are dictated by the subparts of the ruling (codified at 40 CFR Part 98 for those interested), in the case of CCUS, the three most relevant subparts are subpart PP, UU, and RR. </p>

<p><b>Subpart UU</b> covers underground injection whereas <b>subpart RR</b> covers geologic sequestration. Underground injection is self-explanatory, and there are a variety of reasons why a company may inject carbon. One of the most common reasons is <b>enhanced oil recovery (EOR)</b>, which “is a process for extracting oil that has not already been retrieved through the primary or secondary oil recovery techniques” (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enhanced-oil-recovery.asp">“Enhanced Oil Recovery”</a>). EOR is commonly used by oil companies, such as ExxonMobil, and is a fairly common use of carbon injection (per the red squares on the map). On the other hand, <b>geologic sequestration (GS)</b>, which is covered by subpart RR, is “the process of storing carbon dioxide (CO2) in underground geologic formations” ("What's the Difference"). This process can also be used for EOR, so there is some overlap between subparts UU and RR. </p>
